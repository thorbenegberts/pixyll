Hi there! My name is Thorben Egberts. I am Software Developer, Scrum Master and Agile Coach.

Software Development is my nature, however I am just as attracted by "social software" (people, teams and how organizations work). This lead me to Agile and Lean Methodologies.

I'm currently working as an Agile Coach at [plentymarkets](https://www.plentymarkets.eu/) in [Kassel, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/CyhHe).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thorbenegberts), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ThorbenEgberts/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tegberts), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/thorben-egberts/85/690/94b), [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Thorben_Egberts), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/thorben-egberts) and [GitHub](https://github.com/thorbenegberts).

You can also find me regulary at the [Agile Monday Kassel](http://www.agile-monday.de/kassel/).
