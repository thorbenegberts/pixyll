Hi there! My name is Thorben Egberts. I'm an Agile Coach & Scrum Master. Software development is my nature. However, Iâ€™m interested in how people function so differently than machines. This led me to Agile Product Development and Coaching.

I'm working at [SMA Solar Technology AG](https://www.sma.de/en) in [Kassel, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/CyhHe) as a [Scrum Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)). Before that I've been working as an Agile Coach and Trainer at [plentymarkets](https://www.plentymarkets.eu/) in [Kassel, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/CyhHe). I've also been one of the organizers of the Agile Usergroup Kassel.

Aside from this blog I write (usually more frequently) on [Medium](https://medium.com/@thorbenegberts/). You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thorbenegberts), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/thorben-egberts/85/690/94b) and [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Thorben_Egberts).
