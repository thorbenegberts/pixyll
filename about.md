Hi there! My name is Thorben Egberts. I'm a software developer, certified scrum master, certified product owner and agile coach.

Software development is my nature, however I am just as attracted by "social software" (people, teams and how organizations work). This lead me to Agile, Lean and related things. I'm working as an agile coach at [plentymarkets](https://www.plentymarkets.eu/) in [Kassel, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/CyhHe). I am also co-organizer of the [Agile Monday Kassel](http://www.agile-monday.de/kassel/) ([Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/agile-monday-kassel), [XING](https://www.xing.com/communities/groups/agile-monday-kassel-1050362)).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thorbenegberts), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/thorben-egberts/85/690/94b), [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Thorben_Egberts) and [GitHub](https://github.com/thorbenegberts).
