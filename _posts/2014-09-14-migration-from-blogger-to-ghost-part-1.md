I just migrated from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) to a (self hosted) [Ghost](https://ghost.org/download/) blogging platform. My fear was that it would be a mess, and ist was, but it did not have to be. Sadly enough, I could have saved my weekend, if had been less impulsive and just did some more research before. But let's start from the beginning.

I started blogging on Blogger only because I wanted to start quickly without any technical setup. It was not because I was not able to. It was just because I had not enough time.

It could be a great excuse for my poor frequence of writing new blog posts, however writing with Blogger has not been a pleasure. It felt like a late 90s WYSIWYG-Editor. Formatting was a painful process, especially if I had to deal with images. In that time I started writing with [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/) in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and exported the resulting HTML to Blogger. To put it in a nutshell, I felt neither productive nor was it much fun. I felt it was time for a change.

In my next blog post you will read how I heard of Ghost and why I decided to make a change.
