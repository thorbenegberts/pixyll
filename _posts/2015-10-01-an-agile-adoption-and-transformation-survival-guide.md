I just finished the book [An Agile Adoption and Transformation Survival Guide](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/agile-adoption-transformation) by [Michael Sahota](https://twitter.com/michaelsahota). It deals with the mostly underrated – here I’m no exception – topic of potentially necessary shifts in culture on the way to "being agile" as an organisation. He points out that there is a difference between an *adoption* and *transformation* towards agile.

An adoption of agile is the attempt of introducing agile methods and practices, which requires a culture that are compatible to them. This is rarely the case. Far more often there is a *mismatched* culture, that needs to be shifted towards one that is compatible before agile is truly can be sustainable introduced and creates less damage to the organisation. As we take a look at the [9th Annual State of Agile™ Survey](https://www.versionone.com/pdf/state-of-agile-development-survey-ninth.pdf), two of the top five causes of agile project failure were related to company culture (42%) and the top cause of barriers for further agile adoption where pointing to a lack of ability to change the organizational culture (44%). This is as enlightening as it is alarming.

To promote his assertion, Sahota uses the Schneider Culture Model based on William Schneider’s book [The Reengineering Alternative: A plan for making your current culture work](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1304112.Sre_the_Reengineering_Alternative) (which will be one of my next reads). If you’re interested in the topic, follow the link to the article [How to Make Your Culture Work with Agile, Kanban & Software Craftsmanship](http://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/agileculture.php) for further reading and some enlightenment about the role of culture for change initiatives. And don't miss the [Agile Adoption and Transformation Survival Guide](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/agile-adoption-transformation) itself. It's free. Also with just about 70 pages it's a short read that provides you a buffet of dense information to choose from for further exploration.

And thanks to [Patrick Koglin](http://www.koglin.net/) for bringing me on the track of the topic.
