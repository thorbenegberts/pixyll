If you find yourself in the position to automate [WebDav](http://www.webdav.org/) operations like upload, move, copy or delete, consider the use of the [easywebdav](https://github.com/amnong/easywebdav) python library. It's very easy to use. If you like, [take a look at my script](https://github.com/thorbenegberts/webdav-upload-script) that currently supports uploading of files. As usual, feel free to use, fork or tear it to pieces. If you like to add other functionalities to the script, why won't you contribute?
